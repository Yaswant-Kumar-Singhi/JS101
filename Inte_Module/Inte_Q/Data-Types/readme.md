# Javascrpit Data Types

 - Javascript Data Types are divided into 2 parts : 

```
.
├── Data Types
    ├── Primitive Data type  
    ├── Non-Primitive Data type  

```

### Primitive Data Type 

<p>
 In JavaScript, a primitive (primitive value, primitive data type) is data that is not an object and has no methods. 
All primitives are immutable, i.e., they cannot be altered. It is important not to confuse a primitive itself with a variable assigned a primitive value.

</p>


```
This primitive data types can further be classified into - 

    ├── Primitive Data Types
      ├── String
      ├── BigInt
      ├── Undefined
      ├── Null
      ├── Symbol
      ├── Boolean
      └── Number

```

#### String : 
```
It represents a series of characters and is written with quotes. A string can be represented using a single or a double quote.

Example :
 var str = "Vivek Singh Bisht"; //using double quotes
 var str2 = 'John Doe'; //using single quotes
```
