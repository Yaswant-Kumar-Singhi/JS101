### Primitive Data Type 

<p>
 In JavaScript, a primitive (primitive value, primitive data type) is data that is not an object and has no methods. 
All primitives are immutable, i.e., they cannot be altered. It is important not to confuse a primitive itself with a variable assigned a primitive value.

      ├── String
      ├── BigInt
      ├── Undefined
      ├── Null
      ├── Symbol
      ├── Boolean
